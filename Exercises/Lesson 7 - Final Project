<1st step: Attach a dataset to the notebook>
Begin by selecting a CSV dataset from Kaggle Datasets. If you're unsure how to do this, please revisit the instructions in the previous tutorial. Once you have selected a dataset, click
on the [+ Add data] option in the top right corner. This will generate a pop-up window that you can use to search for your chosen dataset.

Once you have found the dataset, click on the [Add] button to attach it to the notebook. You can check that it was successful by looking at the Data dropdown menu to the right of the not
ebook; look for an input folder containing a subfolder that matches the name of the dataset. You can click on the carat to the left of the name of the dataset to double-check that it con
tains a CSV file. For instance, the image below shows that the example dataset contains two CSV files:
(1) dc-wikia-data.csv
(2) marvel-wikia-data.csv

Once you've uploaded a dataset with a CSV file, run the code cell below without changes to receive credit for your work!

****************
# Check for a dataset with a CSV file
step_1.check()

Correct
****************

<2nd step: Specify the filepath>
Now that the dataset is attached to the notebook, you can find its filepath. To do this, begin by clicking on the CSV file you'd like to use. This will open the CSV file in a tab below
the notebook. You can find the filepath towards the top of this new tab.

After you find the filepath corresponding to your dataset, fill it in as the value for my_filepath in the code cell below, and run the code cell to check that you've provided a valid fil
epath. For instance, in the case of this example dataset, we would set:
my_filepath = "../input/fivethirtyeight-comic-characters-dataset/dc-wikia-data.csv"

Note that you must enclose the filepath in quotation marks; otherwise, the code will return an error. Once you've entered the filepath, you can close the tab below the notebook by click
ing on the [X] at the top of the tab.

****************
# Fill in the line below: Specify the path of the CSV file to read
my_filepath = "../input/fivethirtyeight-comic-characters-dataset/dc-wikia-data.csv"

# Check for a valid filepath to a CSV file in a dataset
step_2.check()

Correct
****************

<3rd step: Load the data>
Use the next code cell to load your data file into my_data. Use the filepath that you specified in the previous step.

****************
# Fill in the line below: Read the file into a variable my_data
my_data = pd.read_csv(my_filepath)

# Check that a dataset has been uploaded into my_data
step_3.check()

Correct
****************

After the code cell above is marked correct, run the code cell below without changes to view the first five rows of the data.

****************
# Print the first five rows of the data
my_data.head()

<4th step: Visualize the data>
Use the next code cell to create a figure that tells a story behind your dataset. You can use any chart type (line chart, bar chart, heatmap, etc.) of your choosing!

****************
# Create a plot
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.title("FiveThirtyEight Comic Characters Biography")
sns.barplot(x=my_data.index, y=my_data['APPEARANCES'])

# Check that a figure appears below
step_4.check()

Correct
