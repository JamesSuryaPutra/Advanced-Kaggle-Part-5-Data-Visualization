<Scenario>
You'll work with a real-world dataset containing information collected from microscopic images of breast cancer tumors. Each tumor has been labeled as either benign (non-cancerous) or mal
ignant (cancerous).

<Setup>
Run the next cell to import and configure the Python libraries that you need to complete the exercise.

****************
import pandas as pd
pd.plotting.register_matplotlib_converters()
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import seaborn as sns
print("Setup Complete")

Setup Complete
****************

The questions below will give you feedback on your work. Run the following cell to set up our feedback system.

****************
# Set up code checking
from learntools.core import binder
binder.bind(globals())
from learntools.data_viz_to_coder.ex5 import *
print("Setup Complete")

Setup Complete
****************

<1st step: Load the data>
In this step, you will load the data.
1} Load the data file into a DataFrame called cancer_data.
2} The corresponding filepath is cancer_filepath.
3} Use the "Id" column to label the rows.

****************
# Path of the files to read
cancer_filepath = "../input/cancer.csv"

# Fill in the line below to read the file into a variable cancer_data
cancer_data = pd.read_csv(cancer_filepath, index_col="Id")

# Run the line below with no changes to check that you've loaded the data correctly
step_1.check()

Correct

# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
step_1.hint()
step_1.solution()

Hint:
Use pd.read_csv, and follow it with two pieces of text that are enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
(1) The filepath for the dataset is provided in cancer_filepath.
(2) Use the "Id" column to label the rows.

Solution:
cancer_data = pd.read_csv(cancer_filepath, index_col="Id")
****************

<2nd step: Review the data>
Use a Python command to print the first 5 rows of the data.

****************
# Print the first five rows of the data
cancer_data.head()

5 rows Ã— 31 columns
****************

In the dataset, each row corresponds to a different image. The dataset has 31 different columns, corresponding to:
1} 1 column ('Diagnosis') that classifies tumors as either benign (which appears in the dataset as B) or malignant (M).
2} 30 columns containing different measurements collected from the images.

Use the first 5 rows of the data to answer the questions below.

****************
# Fill in the line below: In the first five rows of the data, what is the
# largest value for 'Perimeter (mean)'?
max_perim = 87.46

# Fill in the line below: What is the value for 'Radius (mean)' for the tumor with Id 8510824?
mean_radius = 9.504

# Check your answers
step_2.check()

Correct

# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
step_2.hint()
step_2.solution()

Hint:
Use the head() command to print the first 5 rows. After printing the first 5 rows, each row corresponds to a different tumor ID. The 'Perimeter (mean)' column is the fourth column in
the dataset. The 'Radius (mean)' column is the second column.

Solution:
# Print the first five rows of the data
cancer_data.head()
# In the first five rows of the data, what is the
# largest value for 'Perimeter (mean)'?
max_perim = 87.46
# What is the value for 'Radius (mean)' for the tumor with Id 8510824?
mean_radius = 9.504
****************

<3rd step: Investigating differences>
Part A:
Use the code cell below to create two histograms that show the distribution in values for 'Area (mean)', separately for both benign and malignant tumors (to permit easy comparison, cre
ate a single figure containing both histograms in the code cell below).

****************
# Histograms for benign and maligant tumors
sns.histplot(data=cancer_data,
             x=cancer_data['Area (mean)'],
             hue='Diagnosis')

# Check your answer
step_3.a.check()

Correct

# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
step_3.a.hint()
step_3.a.solution_plot()

Hint:
Use sns.histplot, and set the data and column by using data= and x=, respectively. To separate the data according to whether it is benign or malignant, use hue=.

Solution:
# Histograms for benign and maligant tumors
sns.histplot(data=cancer_data, x='Area (mean)', hue='Diagnosis')
****************

Part B:
A researcher approaches you for help with identifying how the 'Area (mean)' column can be used to understand the difference between benign and malignant tumors. Based on the histograms
above, do malignant tumors have higher or lower values for 'Area (mean)' (relative to benign tumors), on average? Which tumor type seems to have a larger range of potential values?

****************
step_3.b.hint()

Hint:
Does the histogram for malignant tumors appear mostly to the left or to the right of the histogram for benign tumors? Which histogram appears wider?

# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)
step_3.b.solution()

Solution:
Malignant tumors have higher values for 'Area (mean)', on average. Malignant tumors have a larger range of potential values.
****************

<4th step: A very useful column>
Part A:
Use the code cell below to create two KDE plots that show the distribution in values for 'Radius (worst)', separately for both benign and malignant tumors (to permit easy comparison, cre
ate a single figure containing both KDE plots in the code cell below).

****************
# KDE plots for benign and malignant tumors
sns.kdeplot(data=cancer_data,
            x='Radius (worst)',
            hue='Diagnosis',
            shade=True)

# Check your answer
step_4.a.check()

Correct

# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
step_4.a.hint()
step_4.a.solution_plot()

Hint:
Use sns.kdeplot, and specify the data and label by using data= and x=, respectively. To separate the data according to whether it is benign or malignant, use hue=. Set shade=True.

Solution:
# KDE plots for benign and malignant tumors
sns.kdeplot(data=cancer_data, x='Radius (worst)', hue='Diagnosis', shade=True)
****************

Part B:
A hospital has recently started using an algorithm that can diagnose tumors with high accuracy. Given a tumor with a value for 'Radius (worst)' of 25, do you think the algorithm is more
likely to classify the tumor as benign or malignant?

****************
step_4.b.hint()

Hint:
Take a look at the KDE plots, and use the legend to tell the difference between malignant and benign tumors. Around a value of 25, which curve appears higher?

# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)
step_4.b.solution()

Solution:
The algorithm is more likely to classify the tumor as malignant. This is because the curve for malignant tumors is much higher than the curve for benign tumors around a value of 25; and
an algorithm that gets high accuracy is likely to make decisions based on this pattern in the data.
