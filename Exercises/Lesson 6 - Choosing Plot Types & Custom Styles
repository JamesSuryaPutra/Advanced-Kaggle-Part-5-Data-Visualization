<Setup>
Run the next cell to import and configure the Python libraries that you need to complete the exercise.

****************
import pandas as pd
pd.plotting.register_matplotlib_converters()
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import seaborn as sns
print("Setup Complete")

Setup Complete
****************

The questions below will give you feedback on your work. Run the following cell to set up our feedback system.

****************
# Set up code checking
import os
if not os.path.exists("../input/spotify.csv"):
    os.symlink("../input/data-for-datavis/spotify.csv", "../input/spotify.csv") 
from learntools.core import binder
binder.bind(globals())
from learntools.data_viz_to_coder.ex6 import *
print("Setup Complete")

Setup Complete
****************

You'll work with a chart from the previous tutorial. Run the next cell to load the data.

****************
# Path of the file to read
spotify_filepath = "../input/spotify.csv"

# Read the file into a variable spotify_data
spotify_data = pd.read_csv(spotify_filepath, index_col="Date", parse_dates=True)
****************

<Try out seaborn styles>
Run the command below to try out the "dark" theme.

****************
# Change the style of the figure
sns.set_style("ticks")

# Line chart 
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.lineplot(data=spotify_data)

# Mark the exercise complete after the code cell is run
step_1.check()

Correct
****************

Now, try out different themes by amending the first line of code and running the code cell again. Remember the list of available themes:
- "darkgrid"
- "whitegrid"
- "dark"
- "white"
- "ticks"

This notebook is your playground; feel free to experiment as little or as much you wish here! The exercise is marked as complete after you run every code cell in the notebook at least
once.
